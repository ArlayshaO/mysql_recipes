# mysql_recipes
 
* This lab is going to be relatively simple, since this is all new. Weâ€™re going to pull down the script to build the Recipe Database and build schema in the left side of http://sqlfiddle.com/. 
* After the database is created, do the following: 
    * Comment the code and clearly explain what the script is doing when you get it. Also comment and document everything you add. //done
    * Insert 5 new recipes and their ingredients, amounts, and measures into the Database.//done
    * Write a query to get a list of all the Recipes from the Database.//done
    * And write a query to get all the Recipes that use a certain ingredient. //done
    * Write a query to update a recipe you added.
* Run your script so you can see your collections built and the operations run on it. 
* Take some time to poke around outside of your script with the database! 
* Then push your new script back to GitHub.
